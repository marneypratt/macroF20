"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00002.001"
"Name: Single aspirated air temperature"
"Description: Air temperature, available as one- and thirty-minute averages of 1 Hz observations. Observations are made by sensors located at multiple heights on the tower infrastructure and by sensors located on the aquatic meteorological station. Temperature observations are made using platinum resistance thermometers, which are housed in a fan aspirated shield to reduce radiative bias."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: TIS"
"Abstract: Single aspirated air temperature measurements, available as one- and thirty-minute averages of 1 Hz observations. Temperature is one of the most fundamental physical measurements.  It is a primary driving factor for countless physical, chemical, and biological processes. The single aspirated sensor assembly comprises an individual Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT) housed within an aspirated shield."
"Latency:"
"Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month."
"Brief Design Description: Multiple Single Aspirated Air Temperature (SAAT) assemblies are deployed at tower sites. SAAT assemblies are located on each boom arm below the top of the tower. A single SAAT assembly is deployed at aquatic sites and is located on the aquatic met station 3m above ground level."
"Brief Study Area Description: These data are collected at all NEON terrestrial and aquatic sites."
"Sensor(s): Thermometrics Climate RTD 100 O Probe, housed within a Met One 076B fan aspirated radiation shield"
"Keywords: met station, air temperature, single aspirated air temperature (SAAT), platinum resistance thermometers (PRT), profile, tower, meteolorogy"

"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 ="

"Issue: Coefficients used in IS data processing to compute the uncertainty contributed by resistance or voltage readings made by the field data acquisition system (FDAS) were updated. The updated coefficients are based on a larger FDAS sample and are larger than previous estimates. Although the difference between previous uncertainty estimates and updated estimates is small, there may be periods for which the FDAS uncertainty represents the largest source of uncertainty.

"Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release.

"ADDITIONAL REMARKS"
"------------------"
"Due to an implementation error affecting flow rates within the aspirated assembly, the flow quality metrics in the expanded data product have been incorrectly generated. This affects final quality flagging of the product. Archived (historic) data will be re-processed accordingly over the next six months. Data from August 17, 2017 and forward will be archived internally but not publicly released until the reprocessing framework is in place."
"NEON DATA POLICY AND CITATION GUIDELINES"
"----------------------------------------"
"Please visit http://data.neonscience.org/data-policy for more information about NEON's data policy and citation guidelines."
"DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"---------------------------"
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."
""
"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing"
