"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20267.001"
"Name: Gauge height"
"Description: Gauge height, in meters, measured at lakes, wadeable streams and non-wadeable streams."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS"
"Abstract: Gauge height is the height of the water surface above an established altitude where the stage is zero. The zero level is arbitrary, but is often close to the streambed. Gauge height at stream sites will be related to measurements of stream discharge to formulate stage-discharge rating curves at all NEON stream and river sites. Rating equations will be applied to continuous surface water elevation data in order to calculate continuous stream discharge at all NEON aquatic sites. For additional details, see protocol [NEON.DOC. 001085]( http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.001085vD): AOS Protocol and Procedure: Stream Discharge, [NEON.DOC.001646](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.001646vC): General AQU Field"
"Latency:"
"The expected time from data and/or sample collection in the field to data publication is as follows, for each of the data tables (in days) in the downloaded data package. See the Data Product User Guide for more information."
"gag_fieldData:  30"
"Brief Design Description: Gauge measurements and field metadata are collected at all aquatic sites whenever any other protocol is implemented. For protocols that may be performed in shifts multiple times a day, e.g. fish sampling, there can be multiple gauge records per site per date that cover different time ranges. In total, gauge height is measured several times per month per site."
"Brief Study Area Description: Gauge height is measured at all NEON aquatic sites."
"Sensor(s): Oregon Rule Co. staff gauge"

"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON observational systems (OS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year."
"DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table."
"YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file."
"PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
"Time stamp conventions:"
"YYYY: Year"
"YY: Year, last two digits only"
"MM: Month: 01-12"
"DD: Day: 01-31"
"T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning"
"HH: Hours: 00-23"
"mm: Minutes: 00-59"
"SS: Seconds: 00-59"
"Z: Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time), or UTC"

"Obfuscation of Personnel Information: At times it is important to know which data were collected by particular observers. In order to protect privacy of NEON technicians while also providing a way to consistently identify different observers, we obfuscate each NEON personnel name by internally linking it to a unique string identifier (e.g., Jane Doe=ByrziN0LguMJHnInl2NM/trZeA5h+c0) and publishing only the identifier."
"CHANGE LOG"

"ADDITIONAL REMARKS"
"------------------"
"Queries for this data product will return data from gag_fieldData collected during the date range specified. Gauge measurements and field metadata are collected at all aquatic sites whenever another protocol is implemented; gauge data can be joined to other data by site, date, and time. Duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before analyzing data."

"DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"---------------------------"
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."

"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to"
