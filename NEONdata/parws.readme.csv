"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20042.001"
"Name: Photosynthetically active radiation at water surface"
"Description: Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) observations represent the radiation flux at wavelengths between 400-700 nm, which constitute the wavelengths that drive photosynthesis. This data product is available as one-, five-,  and thirty-minute averages. Observations are made at the aquatic sensor set location at lakes, non-wadeable streams, and wadeable streams."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS"
"Abstract: Photosynthetically active radiation at water surface is measured at 1 Hz at stream sensor sets and twice per minute on buoys at lake and river sites. It is reported as 1-minute mean measurements and 30-minute mean values."
"Latency:"
"Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month."
"Brief Design Description: The stream sensor sets measure PAR at water surface, water level and temperature, and water quality. Downstream sensors also measure nitrate. The buoys are comprised of sensor sets which measure meteorological parameters over a water surface along with submerged sensors that measure physical and chemical parameters of the water body. Some of these sensors are unique to the buoy subsystem and others are shared with other NEON subsystems, such as the wadeable stream sensor sets or terrestrial towers. Due to power, space, and data storage constraints on the buoy, the configuration of sensors deployed on a buoy may be different than those in other parts of NEON."
"Brief Study Area Description: S1 (upstream) and S2 (downstream) sensor sets are at all stream sites within NEON. Buoys will be deployed at all lake and large river sites within NEON."
"Sensor(s): Kipp & Zonen - PQS1"
"Keywords: productivity, aquatic, solar radiation, metabolism, rivers, buoy, lakes, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), surface water, biogeochemistry"

"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."

For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year."

"Issue: Coefficients used in IS data processing to compute the uncertainty contributed by resistance or voltage readings made by the field data acquisition system (FDAS) were updated. The updated coefficients are based on a larger FDAS sample and are larger than previous estimates. Although the difference between previous uncertainty estimates and updated estimates is small, there may be periods for which the FDAS uncertainty represents the largest source of uncertainty. Data produced after the resolution date have been produced with the updated coefficients. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release.

The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release.

"DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"---------------------------"
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."

"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and"
