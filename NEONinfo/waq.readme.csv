"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20288.001"
"Name: Water quality"
"Description: In situ sensor-based specific conductivity, concentration of chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen content, fDOM concentration, pH, and turbidity, available as one- or five-minute instantaneous measurements in surface water of lakes, wadeable streams, and non-wadeable streams."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS"
"Abstract: Water quality is measured once per minute at stream sensor sets and once per 5 minutes on buoys at lake and river sites. It is reported as 1- or 5-minute instantaneous measurements."
"Latency:"
"Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month."
"Brief Design Description: The water quality sondes are deployed at stream sensor sets and lake and river buoys. At stream sites, the sondes are affixed to a post at a static depth relative to the stream bottom. The upstream sensor set #1 (S1) collects specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, and turbidity, but no fDOM. The downstream sensor set #2 (S2) collects specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, turbidity and fDOM. The buoy-deployed multisondes collect specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, turbidity, fDOM, and depth. At all but the Flint River, GA (FLNT) buoys, the water quality multisonde is fixed to a profiling"
"Brief Study Area Description: S1 (upstream) and S2 (downstream) sensor sets are at all wadeable stream sites within NEON. Buoys are deployed at all lake and large river sites within NEON."
"Sensor(s): YSI EXO2 Multiparameter Sonde; YSI EXO turbidity sensor; YSI EXO total algae PC sensor; YSI EXO pH sensor; YSI EXO dissolved oxygen sensor; YSI EXO fDOm sensor; YSI EXO conductivity and temperature sensor; YSI EXO central wiper"
"Keywords: lakes, chlorophyll a, sonde, buoy, multisonde, surface water, conductivity, streams, water quality, dissolved organic matter (DOM), specific conductance, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), aquatic, rivers, pH, temperature, fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM)"

"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air"
"DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table."
"YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file."
"PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
"Time stamp conventions:"
"YYYY: Year"
"YY: Year, last two digits only"
"MM: Month: 01-12"
"DD: Day: 01-31"
"T: Indicator that the time stamp is beginning"
"HH: Hours: 00-23"
"mm: Minutes: 00-59"
"SS: Seconds: 00-59"
"Z: Universal Time Coordinated (Universal Coordinated Time), or UTC"

"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern"
