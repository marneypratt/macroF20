"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00006.001"
"Name: Precipitation"
"Description: Precipitation is observed using one of two sensors. Primary precipitation is observed using a weighing gauge housed within a small double fence intercomparison reference, which is generally located within 0.5 km of the tower infrastructure. Secondary precipitation is observed using a tipping bucket located on the top of the tower infrastructure. Ground level precipitation (also known as throughfall) is also observed using tipping buckets at 3 of 5 soil array locations. Bulk precipitation is determined at five- and thirty-minute intervals for primary precipitation and at one- and thirty-minute intervals for secondary precipitation. AIS sites only include Primary (DFIR at Core Aquatic sites; currently only 2 or 3) or Secondary (tipping buckets at relocatable sites; currently about 8). No AIS"
"NEON Science Team Supplier: TIS"
"Abstract: Across NEON sites two methods will be used to determine bulk precipitation. Bulk precipitation measurements at core sites consist of a weighing gauge surrounded by a double fence inter-comparison reference (DFIR). Bulk precipitation measurements at relocatable sites are made with a tipping bucket. Bulk precipitation measured using a DFIR and a weighing gauge is known to provide improved results over tipping bucket measurements. Thus, the weighing gauge surrounded by the DFIR is considered the “primary” method, while the tipping bucket is referred to as the “secondary” method."
"Latency:"
"Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month."
"Brief Design Description: Primary precipitation will be measured by a weighing gauge surrounded by a small double fence inter-comparison reference (DFIR) at all core terrestrial sites.  Secondary precipitation will be measured by a tipping bucket at all terrestrial relocatable sites, a select number of terrestrial core sites, and at aquatic sites.  Throughfall will be measured by a tipping bucket equipped with troughs (extending outward from the tipping bucket) at all terrestrial sites where the canopy is seasonally taller than the height of the throughfall collectors' inlets."
"Brief Study Area Description: Some form of precipitation data are collected at all NEON terrestrial and aquatic sites."
"Sensor(s): Belfort AEPG II 600M weighing gauge (primary precipitation), Met One 372 tipping bucket (non-heated; secondary precipitation and throughfall) and 379 tipping bucket (heated; secondary precipitation)"

"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."

"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year."
"DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table."

"Issue: Spurious trace precipitation is recorded frequently for all primary precipitation sensors (weighing gauges). While actual precipitation events are typically distinguishable from spurious events in the time series, the spurious events can add significantly to precipitation totals when aggregated over long intervals.  Sums of spurious precipitation range from < 0.05 mm/day to > 0.5mm/day, with higher sums generally corresponding to sites and time periods of greater evaporative demand.  "

"ADDITIONAL REMARKS"
"------------------"
"KNOWN ISSUE 2018-04-04: All current and previous throughfall precipitation data should be considered unreliable and of limited use. The tipping mechanism frequently falls off its rocker, causing precipitation events to go unrecorded. A more robust design of the tipping mechanism is currently in production and all sensors will be retrofitted. All throughfall precipitation data will be quality flagged as suspect until the sensor retrofit is complete."
"KNOWN ISSUE 2020-06-10: A review of the precipitation data product (part of DP1.00006.001) identified that spurious trace precipitation is recorded frequently for all primary precipitation sensors. While actual precipitation events are typically distinguishable from spurious events in the time series, the presence of spurious trace precipitation can add significantly to precipitation totals when aggregated over long intervals.  Sums of spurious precipitation range from < 0.05 mm/day to > 0.5mm/day, with higher sums generally corresponding to sites and time periods of greater evaporative demand.  We are working on additional quality control algorithms in order to detect and remove spurious trace events in the primary precipitation data product. An updated algorithm is expected sometime in 2021."
"NEON DATA POLICY AND CITATION GUIDELINES"
"----------------------------------------"
"Please visit http://data.neonscience.org/data-policy for more information about NEON's data policy and citation guidelines."
"DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"---------------------------"
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."
""
"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency."
