"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20053.001"
"Name: Temperature (PRT) in surface water"
"Description: Surface water temperature, available as one-, five-, and thirty-minute  averages, measured by a platinum resistance thermometer at the sensor location in lakes, wadeable and non-wadeable streams"
"NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS"
"Abstract: This data product contains quality-controlled continuous surface water temperature readings from a sensor within each of NEON's wade-able stream sensor sets."
"Latency:"
"Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month."
"Brief Design Description: Surface water temperature is measured using a platinum resistance thermometer that acquires resistance readings at 1 Hz. NEON coverts the raw resistance data product into temperature and reports at 1 minute intervals."
"Brief Study Area Description: All wadeable stream sites monitor stream water temperature at both the upstream and downstream sensor set locations."
"Sensor(s): Thermometrics -- R032-00000048"
"Keywords: aquatic, water temperature, water quality, biogeochemistry, metabolism, surface water, ecohydrology, hydrology, stream"
"DATA PACKAGE CONTENTS"
"---------------------"
"This data product contains up to 2 data tables:"
"TSW_5min - Temperature of surface water from PRT summarized over 5 minutes"
"TSW_30min - Temperature of surface water from PRT summarized over 30 minutes"
"If data are unavailable for the particular sites and dates queried, some tables may be absent."
"Basic download package definition: Includes the data product, summary statistics, expanded uncertainty, and final quality flag."
"Expanded download package definition: Includes the basic package information plus quality metrics for all of the quality assessment and quality control analyses."
"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"General conventions, used for all data products:"
"NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."
"DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;"
"PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 ="
NA
"DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table."
"YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file."
"PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
"Time stamp conventions:"
"YYYY: Year"
"YY: Year, last two digits only"

"---------------------------"
"The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."

"Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing"
