"10","ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20166.001"
"11","Name: Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection"
"12","Description: Collection and biomass of periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton using multiple benthic and water column sampling methods in lakes, non-wadeable streams, and wadeable streams"
"13","NEON Science Team Supplier: AOS"
"14","Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's aquatic periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection and field metadata, as well as associated taxonomic, morphometric, and count analyses data provided by a contracted lab. Benthic and water column field samples are collected in wadeable streams, rivers, and lakes three times per year during the growing season. Samples are processed at the domain support facility and separated into aliquots for taxonomic analysis (preserved in glutaraldehyde or Lugol's iodine) for shipment to an external facility, or filtered onto glass-fiber filters for biomass (ash-free dry mass). For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section in this data product's details webpage."
"15","The expected time from data and/or sample collection in the field to data publication is as follows, for each of the data tables (in days) in the downloaded data package. See the Data Product User Guide for more information."

"21","Brief Design Description: Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton samples are collected three times per year at wadeable stream, river, and lake sites during aquatic biology bout windows, roughly in spring, summer, and fall. Samples are collected using the most approriate sampler for the habitat and substratum type, including rock scrubs, grab samples, and epiphyton. In wadeable streams, periphyton samples are collected in the two most dominant benthic habitat types (e.g. riffles, runs, pools, step pools), and seston samples are collected from the water column near the S2 sensor. In lakes, water-column phytoplankton samples are collected near the buoy, inlet, and outlet sensors using a Kemmerer sampler, and in littoral areas using the best benthic sampling method for the substratum type. In rivers, phytoplankton samples are collected near the buoy and two other deep-water locations using a Kemmerer sampler, and"

"36","FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"37","-----------------------"
"38","NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API."
"39","NEON observational systems (OS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv"
"40","The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information."
"41","General conventions, used for all data products:"
"42","NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI."
"43","DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)."
"44","SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code."

"46","PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)."
"47","REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new."
"48","HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005."
"49","VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505."
"50","TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year."
"51","DESC: an abbreviated description of the data file or table."
"52","YYYY-MM: the year and month of the data in the file."
"53","PKGTYPE: the type of data package downloaded. Options are 'basic', representing the basic download package, or 'expanded',representing the expanded download package (see more information below)."
"54","GENTIME: the date-time stamp when the file was generated, in UTC. The format of the date-time stamp is YYYYMMDDTHHmmSSZ."
"55","Time stamp conventions:"

"74","Protection of species of concern: At most sites, taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed', i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published."
"75","Obfuscation of Personnel Information: At times it is important to know which data were collected by particular observers. In order to protect privacy of NEON technicians while also providing a way to consistently identify different observers, we obfuscate each NEON personnel name by internally linking it to a unique string identifier (e.g., Jane Doe=ByrziN0LguMJHnInl2NM/trZeA5h+c0) and publishing only the identifier."

"78","ADDITIONAL REMARKS"
"79","------------------"
"80","Queries for this data product will return all data for `alg_fieldData`, `alg_biomass`, and `alg_taxonomyProcessed` during the date range specified. Each record in `alg_fieldData` may have zero to 20 child records in `alg_biomass` (initial subsampling information, including filter volumes, AFDM measurement, and taxonomy preservation), alg_taxonomyRaw (raw external lab taxonomic data), and `alg_taxonomyProcessed` (processed taxonomic data). Every record in `alg_biomass,` `alg_taxonomyRaw`, and `alg_taxonomyProcessed` should have a corresponding record in `alg_fieldData` describing field collection conditions, location, and metadata during sample collection. In `alg_biomass`, there should be one unique record for each sampleID - analysisType - filterNumber combination. `alg_taxonomyRaw` and `alg_taxonomyProcessed` will have multiple records per sampleID, organized by scientificName and algalParameter.

"84","DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"85","---------------------------"
"86","The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed."
"87",""
"88","Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency."
