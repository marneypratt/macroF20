# Import Prepared Data

There are several files in the "preppedData" folder.  Below is the code to import each file.  Delete any code chunks you don't need (only import the data you actually need)


## Mill River Data only

```{r Mill only}

# this chunk will import the data for the Mill River only
# this file includes all the Mill River data including all water quality and weather data
# see the file called mill_macro_metadata.txt for details about all these variables and methods
